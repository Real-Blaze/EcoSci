# EcoSci Assistant 🌿🔬

**EcoSci** is a world-class, AI-powered field companion designed to transform students, nature enthusiasts, and aspiring scientists into active researchers. It combines advanced Computer Vision and Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities with gamified progression to make learning about the environment engaging and rigorous.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Active Expedition System**
Instead of a passive chat, users embark on specific missions.
*   **Mission Selector**: Choose your specialization (Botanist, Zoologist, Geologist, or Field Generalist) to tailor the AI's persona and vocabulary.
*   **Daily Field Missions**: Unique challenges generated daily (e.g., "Find a leaf with parallel veins") to encourage outdoor exploration.

### 2. **Scientific Identification & Analysis**
*   **Morphology Breakdown**: The AI doesn't just name a plant; it analyzes root systems, leaf arrangement (phyllotaxy), and reproductive organs.
*   **Google Grounding**: All facts are cross-referenced with Google Search, providing citations and finding comparative images for specific plant parts.
*   **3D Visualization Prompts**: Helps users visualize structural biology.

### 3. **Gamification & Career Progression**
*   **XP & Leveling**: Earn Experience Points (XP) for every observation, photo upload, and report.
*   **Rank System**: Progress from *Field Intern* to *Principal Investigator*.
*   **Badges**: Unlock achievements like "Night Owl", "Taxonomist", and "Bio-Blitz Agent".
*   **Streaks**: Track daily consistency to build research habits.

### 4. **Lab Report Generator**
*   **Academic Output**: One-click generation of structured PDF-ready reports containing Abstract, Methodology, Results, and Discussion sections.
*   **Perfect for Homework**: Helps students format their findings professionally.

### 5. **Field Tools**
*   **Voice Input**: Dictate observations hands-free while holding specimens.
*   **Smart Camera**: Specialized inputs for capturing field data.
*   **Gallery View**: A visual archive of all your collected specimens.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons
*   **AI Core**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (via `@google/genai` SDK)
*   **Features**: Multimodal input (Text, Audio, Images), Markdown rendering, LocalStorage persistence.

## 🎓 Educational Value

EcoSci utilizes **Scaffolded Instruction** (Zone of Proximal Development). It adapts its language based on the user's input complexity—guiding a 5-year-old with simple terms while debating taxonomy with a university student.
